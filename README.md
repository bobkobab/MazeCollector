# MazeCollector

Simple maze game 

Open index1.html in browser to play

Bugs:
 - player and food can get trapped within walls
 - enemies can get trapped within walls (less significant)
 - player invisible until movement after game replay


Possible Improvements:
 - Complex movement and pathfinding by enemies (currently random)
 - Enemy movement affected by player visibility
